# DeliveryApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## About
This is a project I created to allow for more efficient communication with our friends and family when we went to the hospital to deliver our seconds daughter. The app worked pretty well and we were happy with it. Design is still something I struggle with and am continously working on so it's not the best designed app and I used a lot of pre-made components but I was trying to push features more so than design. I created the application with Angular because I wanted to get a good understanding of how Angular works while at the same time, I knew Angular would allow me to quickly create the app. I obviously had a set deadline of when the app had to be completed and that deadline was not flexible. Even worse so, we both decided to allow for my wife to induce 4 days earlier, so that meant I had to rush more to get it completed. 


## Things I would change
- So a lot of actions are done by merely making transactions in the database. This worked well and I never had problems with it but I wonder if it would have been better had I of use Webhooks rather than having my functions watching for new database documents. 
- I never included a way to delete contacts. This would have been nice while I was testing ui components.
- If I was still working on the project, I would have wrote out my unit tests. There are essentially no unit tests in this project outside of what Angular pre-generates. 
- Through Angular I learned of SASS. I wanted to use it in the project but I was scared of making a major change and spending time fixing bugs rather than building critical features. Had I of had more time I would have taken the time to implement SASS rather than plain CSS.
